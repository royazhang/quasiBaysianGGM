Codes for simulations in paper "Contraction of a quasi-Bayesian model with shrinkage priors in precision matrix estimation"

* Files Omega0_p100_XXX.Rdata store the 100x100 sparse matrices of different patterns. Patterns are generated as described in paper. 
* Files XXXX_1dataset.R run MCMC sampling once and obtain one posterior estimate. It can be run on server in parallel. 
* XXXX_fun.R are MCMC sampling functions.
