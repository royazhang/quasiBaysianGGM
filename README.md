Codes for simulations in paper "Contraction of a quasi-Bayesian model with shrinkage priors in precision matrix estimation"

* Omega0_p100_rnd.Rdata stores the 100x100 sparse matrix of random pattern. Other patterns can be generated as described in paper. 
* XXXX_1dataset.R runs MCMC sampling once and obtain one posterior estimate. It can be run on server in parallel. 
* XXXX_fun.R are MCMC sampling functions.
